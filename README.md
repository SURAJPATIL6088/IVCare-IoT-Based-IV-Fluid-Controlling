# IVCare : IoT Based IV Fluid Controlling.

# Project Objectives:

**1. Enhance Patient Care:** Improve the quality of patient care by providing real-time monitoring of vital signs, medication delivery, and early detection of health issues. <br>
**2. Reduce Human Intervention:** Minimise the need for constant human oversight and intervention in healthcare processes, reducing the risk of human error.<br>
**3. Enable Remote Monitoring:** Facilitate remote monitoring of patients, enabling healthcare professionals to track and respond to changes in real-time, improving patient outcomes.<br>
**4. Usability and Accessibility:** Prioritise user-friendly interfaces that cater to healthcare professionals, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all users.<br>

# Motivation:
- The IVCARE project is driven by the critical need to improve patient safety and optimize healthcare resources in IV fluid management. Manual administration of IV fluids can be prone to errors, causing patient discomfort and potential complications. By automating and remotely monitoring the process, IVCARE aims to enhance patient safety and offer more efficient care. The project is also driven by the growing need for Internet of Things-based healthcare solutions. <br>
- IoT technology integration makes it possible for healthcare practices to adopt novel and revolutionary strategies. IVCARE is in line with the growing trend of technology-driven healthcare by utilizing IoT to automate and precisely manage IV fluid. <br>

# Proposed System

In this proposed system there is an IoT-based IV fluid management solution designed to revolutionize healthcare by providing remote control and monitoring capabilities.

- Components
  1. ESP32 Microcontroller: The brain of the system, responsible for data processing, control logic, and communication.
  2. Load Cell and HX711 Sensor: Precisely measures the weight of the IV fluid bag, ensuring accurate monitoring.
  3. Servo Motor: Regulates the drip rate of IV fluid, allowing for precise control.
  4. Blynk IoT Platform: A user-friendly interface for remote access and control by authorized users.

- How It Works <br>
The ESP32 communicates with sensors and controls the servo motor to achieve the desired drip rate. Data is securely transmitted to and from the Blynk IoT platform, providing real-time feedback and alerts.<br>
